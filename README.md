# matplotlib-challenge
This project analyzes different drug regiment treatments on 250 mice to analyze their overall impacts at reducing tumor sizes. Using matplotlib and pandas, the project plots the data on bar, pie, box, scatter, and line charts to show different trends within the data. A top-level summary is included at the start of the project, and summary charts are available for each drug regimen before digging deeper into four of the best performing drugs.
